## 📖 Overview

InteractComp is a framework for evaluating how large language models manage interactive reasoning tasks. It includes a reusable ReAct-style agent, various search and clarification actions, and an asynchronous evaluation pipeline. With this tool, you can benchmark and analyze interactive reasoning more effectively.

## ⚡ Highlights

- **Multi-action agents**: Built-in `answer`, `search`, and `ask` actions support different interaction modes, including:
  - **Answer-only**: Get direct answers from the model.
  - **Search-only**: Find information instead of answers.
  - **Ask-only**: Pose questions and gather responses.
  - **Full**: Utilize all functionalities together.
  - **Full-with-context**: Include context in interactions for better responses.
  - **Forced-ask**: Ensure questions are always posed.

- **Async evaluation loop**: Our asyncio-based orchestration allows you to benchmark multiple candidate models at the same time. This improves efficiency and speeds up the evaluation process.
